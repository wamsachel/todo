Usage: todo [-lacurb] [-h help] <todo file> [options]
        -l [l]ist items will print the items in <todo file>
        -a [a]dd item(s), (e.g. todo <todo file> "Walk the dog")
        -c [c]heck item off of the <todo file>, needs item no. (e.g todo <todo file> 1)
        -u [u]ncheck item off the <todo file>, needs item no. (similar to -c option)
        -r [r]emove item off the <todo file>, neets item no. (similar to -c option)
        -b [b]uild todo list, in this case an infile is read in place of <todo file>, 
           this file is scanned for lines containing the word TODO
           The remainder of the line after TODO is counted as a todo item
           The found todo items are written to a file specified in the options field.
           If no file is specified, then a file is automatically created called 'TODO'
           (e.g. todo -b code.cpp code.todo)

        NOTE: options a,c,u,r take as an option the item no. in the todo list that will be modified accordingly.  
        However, if no item no. is specified, then the user will be asked to enter a item no.
        one per line, until a Ctrl-C is given 

        NOTE: The l option can be placed after all the other options in order
